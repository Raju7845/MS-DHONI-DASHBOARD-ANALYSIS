Conclusion

ODI (One Day International): Dhoni's ODI performance from 2005 to 2014 demonstrates his ability to consistently score against top-tier teams like England and Australia. His ability to convert fifties into hundreds and deliver high scores under pressure has solidified his legacy in this format.

Test Matches: In the Test format, Dhoni's leadership and wicket-keeping skills were as critical as his batting. His performance against traditional rivals like Australia, England, and Sri Lanka showed his ability to adapt to the longest format of the game, playing a pivotal role in India's rise to the top of the ICC Test rankings during his captaincy.

IPL (Indian Premier League): Dhoni's contributions in the IPL, especially as captain of the Chennai Super Kings (CSK), further highlight his cricketing genius. He is renowned for his remarkable finishes, tactical captaincy, and consistent performance over the years, making him one of the most successful captains in the league's history.

Across all these formats, Dhoni's versatility as a batsman and leader stands out. Whether stabilizing an innings in ODIs, accelerating in T20s, enduring long Test matches, or finishing in IPL matches, Dhoni's impact on the game is unparalleled.
